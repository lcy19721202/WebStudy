				<h1>Our Programs</h1>
				<p>
					At the Beechwood Animal Shelter, we're proud of our innovative
					programs that help animals as well as the local community. Our
					primary mission is <a href="animal-rescue.html"> rescue of
						abandoned pets and stray dogs and cats</a>. We work to place rescued
					animals in loving, safe permanent homes as quickly as possible, but
					some animals may take longer to find a new family. That's where our
					<a href="foster-care.html">pet foster care</a> program comes in.
					Animals that require a little more attention and care, such as
					pregnant or recuperating animals, or those that we don't currently
					have the room for at our main facility, can live temporarily in
					volunteers' homes. If you can't adopt another permament member into
					your pet family, please consider becoming a pet foster caregiver
					today!
				</p>
				<p>
					All animals that come through our facility are examined and treated
					in our on-site <a href="veterinary-care.html">veterinary
						hospital</a>. All animals are spayed or neutered, as well as given
					microchip identification. Affordable veterinary care is also
					available to the public, whether your pet originally came from our
					shelter or not.
				</p>
				<p>
					The companionship of animals can lower blood pressure, ease stress,
					and provide other health benefits to all people, especially older
					adults. However, many older adults are on fixed incomes. Through
					our <a href="seniors.html">Seniors for Seniors</a> program, we
					waive the adoption fee and provide other discounted services to
					people 60 and older who adopt a pet 5 years of age or older. We
					also visit local nursing homes and assisted living communities with
					some of our animals to provide residents who cannot have their own
					pets a chance to enjoy the love and companionship of a gentle cat
					or dog each month.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another community outreach effort is our <a
						href="humane-education.html">Humane Education</a> program. We
					visit local schools to teach children how to be responsible pet
					owners, how to properly hold and touch animals, and when to leave
					them alone. We can also provide small group tours of our
					facilities.
