	<h1>My affable little troll</h1>

	<p>My troll is a friendly, charming & most affable little chap with
		a diminutive size, but a heart of gold. He likes nothing more than to
		help people in need, whether we are talking about an old lady who
		wants to cross the street, a child who has lost his favourite toy, or
		a supervillain for whom world domination is within grasp â€” save for a
		vital component currently in possession of one of his archrivals.</p>

	<p>Ok, so he may get it wrong sometimes, and be a bit too trusting
		(some would say he is afflicted with a gullible nature), but his heart
		is always in the right place. He just needs a gentle push sometimes,
		in the direction of the good guys!</p>

	<h2>Pastimes</h2>

	<p>
		When not out helping those in need, my troll likes to <q>kick back
			and relax.</q> This usually involves go karting, bungee jumping, ice
		skating, horse racing, mud wrestling, fencing, karate lessons, and
		playing guitar in a rock band. Most people are very impressed by his
		wide range of pastimes, as long as he doesn't try to do of them at the
		same time.
	</p>

	<h2>Diet</h2>

	<p>My troll can eat a variety of foods, and in fact is not fussy at
		all: he scoffs anything, from the finest caviar and oysters of the
		Savoy, to the best steak Texas has to offer! His favourite foods
		however, are rotten shark, mouldy Bull Yoghurt&trade; and used stamps.</p>

	<h2>Troll Maths</h2>

	<p>Favourite troll sums include 97 + 1 = 100, 2/3 + 1/3 = 6, and 23
		&times; 2 = 47. My troll was 1st in his class this year, which is
		great considering last year he was 43rd.</p>
