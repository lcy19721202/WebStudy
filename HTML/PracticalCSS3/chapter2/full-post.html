			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>At last, I have assembled a glorious force of knights, worthy
				of being called the knights of Camelot. We have the wisdom and
				intelligence of Sir Bevedere the Wise. We have the faith and
				devotion of Sir Galahad the pure. We have the power, courage and
				incredible strength of Sir Lancelot the Brave. And we have the
				&hellip; Erm &hellip; Ummmm &hellip; minstrels of Sir Robin the
				Not-Quite-So-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot. Let's say a few more words about
				myself, and my loyal followers!</p>

			<h2>King Arthur</h2>

			</figure>

			<p>
				King Arthur &mdash; that's me &mdash; is the King of the Britons, a
				title granted by the fulfillment of a prophecy, whereby he pulled
				the sacred sword &mdash; <a
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excalibur">Excalibur</a> &mdash;
				from the stone, and then had it gifted to him by <a
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_of_the_Lake">the Lady
					of the Lake</a> as the one true King of the Britons. He alone will lead
				his subjects in the light, and defend his proud country against the
				raging barbarian hordes of the Saxons.
			</p>

			<p>
				He has assembled a group of heroes together under the moniker of <a
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_Table">The Knights of
					the round table</a>. Their latest quest is to obtain the <a
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail">holy grail</a>, a
				divine quest handed ot them directly by god. He hates peasents, and
				is scared of French soldiers. He also has an in-depth knowledge of
				bird flight speeds.

			<h2>Sir Bedevere the wise</h2>

				<figcaption>Sir Bedevere, man of science</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedivere">Sir Bedevere</a> the
				wise is a great thinker and scientist, brought into King Arthur's
				knights because of his deep knowledge of science. King Arthur first
				witnessed his amazing skills when he witnessed Bedevere settling a
				dispute between some peasants. They were accusing a woman of being <a
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witches">a witch</a> and in the
				process of lynching her. Bedevere stepped in and gave her a fair
				hearing, scientifically proving that she was in fact a witch by
				using a logical means. He showed that she weighed the same as a
				duck, by floating both on water, therefore a witch she must be.

			<h2>Sir Galahad the pure</h2>

					alt="sir galahad - knight dressed in chainmail with camelot colours"
					width="200" height="200">
				<figcaption>Sir Galahad, pious and pure</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galahad">Sir Galahad</a> is
				the most pious and pure of King Arthur's knights, being closest to
				god, and chosen to be one of the chosen wardens and protectors of
				the holy grail, at the point that the knights obtain the grail. He
				is put in most peril during the grail quest when he chances upon
				Castle Anthrax, a dwelling that houses a convent group comprised of
				chaste but very frustrated maidens, who are unavoidably attracted to
				the brave handsome knight. Galahad is eventually saved for the
				terrible fate of succumbing to their advances by Sir Lancelot.
			</p>

			<h2>Sir Lancelot the brave</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/knights-lancelot.jpg"
					alt="sir lancelot - knight dressed in chainmail with camelot colours"
					width="200" height="200">
				<figcaption>Sir Lancelot, mighty warrior</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancelot">Sir Lancelot</a> was
				the bravest, strongest and most fearsome of King Arthur's knights.
				He was an instrumental figure in most of King Arthur's battles, and
				unmatched in his sword skills. Arthur was the only one who came
				close.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the grail quest, Sir Lancelot has so far succeeded in <q>rescuing</q>
				Sir Galahad from the advances of the maidens of Castle Anthrax, and
				answering a distress call from what he believed to be a fair maiden
				imprisoned against her will by a cruel father in Swamp Castle. After
				he stormed the castle and fought his way through the grounds and up
				to the top of the keep, killing several guards and wedding guests in
				the process, he found out that the distress call was in fact from an
				effeminate young man. Despite this <span lang="fr">faux pas</span>,
				Arthur made some good friends here, namely the Lord of Swamp Castle.

			<h2>Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/knights-robin.jpg"
					alt="sir robin - knight dressed in chainmail with camelot colours"
					width="200" height="200">
				<figcaption>Sir Robin, in a braver moment</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>Sir Robin is about as much use as a chocolate teapot, or a
				blow-up dartboard. This not-so-brave knight took part in the grail
				quest, but unfortunately upheld his reputation, running away at the
				first sign of danger. As he fled from the first whiff of a battle
				with a three-headed giant knight, his minstrels penned a fitting
				tune, chronicling the awe-inspiring way in which their great hero
				had fled.</p>

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>
				A force to be reckoned with, don't you think? Let us hope that we
				can carry the wishes of our lord god, and successfully retrieve the
				holy grail for the
				<del>muddy</del>
				<ins>proud</ins>
				people of Britain.
