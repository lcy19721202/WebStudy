			<p>In our most recent encounter, we met a rather eccentric fellow
				named Tim the enchanter, a conjurer who appears to be able to bring
				forth flames from his finger tips. What manner of man is this? We
				were suspicious from the very beginning, but unfortunately we need
				to trust his word, as he is the only lead we have. He said that we
				need to travel to the nearby caves, as etched on their walls we can
				find a clue as to the location of the Grail. But we must beware the
				dreaded Rabbit of Caerbannog&hellip;</p>

			<p>
				Our journey through a dark foreboding forest involved a terrifying
				encounter with a group of warriors calling themselves the <q>Knights
					who say Ni</q>. They are the keepers of the sacred words <q>Ni</q>, <q>Peng</q>
				and <q>Neee-Wom</q>. They threatened us with their deadly words,
				saying that they would only let us through the forest alive if we
				went to get them a shrubbery. Those who hear the sacred words <q>seldom
					live to tell the tale&hellip;</q>

				<h2>Defeated by the French</h2>

			<img src="images/french.jpg" alt="french soldiers" width="283"
				height="233">

			<p>Today we suffered a tragic defeat! Our hunt for the grail took
				us to a French-occupied castle â€” we hoped that the soldiers there
				could help us find the grail, but instead relations went from bad to
				worse! We were taunted using a variety of exotic insults, one of our
				faithful steeds was killed when they catapulted a cow on top of us,
				and Sir Bevedere's clever plan involving hiding inside a trojan
				rabbit, getting them to bring it inside the castle, then bursting
				out when we were inside failed. We forgot to hide inside the rabbit.</p>

			<p>I really wish Sir Bedevere would change his underwear more
				often than once a year. When on crusades, the enemy can smell us
