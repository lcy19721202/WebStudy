			<h2>Fun facts!</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><q>Our friends in the wild</q> is one of the most expensive
					animated films ever made.</li>
				<li>To create all of the authentic sound effects used in the
					movie, over 11,000 wild animals had to be flown in and recorded in
					the studio.</li>
				<li>This included 3,400 Gazelles and 1,100 hippos, all
					meticulously recorded as part of the savannah choir.</li>
				<li>The most difficult part of the wildlife recording process
					was the strong artistic temperament of Zimbar, who played the part
					of Lauke the Warthog. His demands were so over the top that pat way
					through he was taken off the project.</li>
				<li>Ben Affleck was drafted in to finish Lauke the Warthog's
					parts, at the last minute and at great expense.</li>
				<li><q>Our friends in the wild</q> is set in the savannah of
					Burkina Faso, West Africa.</li>
				<li>This location was chosen as the setting because there were
					worries about litigation from the creators of the Lion King. This
					was aggravated by the fact that Dino Zoozoo, main writer of <q>Our
						friends in the wild</q>, was cautioned by security for running amok in
					Disney studios, shouting abusive taunts about the Lion King.
				</li>
				<li>The government of Burkina Faso is delighted by having a
					major motion picture set there.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>The story so far</h2>
			<p>Our story centres around Lauke the Warthog, a plucky young
				plains dweller who was orphaned at an early age, and raised by a
				large pride of lions. He remembers little of his past, but he is has
				grown into adolescence a courageous brave character. His best friend
				is Pete the Crocodile, a depressive emo with a heart of gold, who
				looks up to Lauke for encouragement and belonging. Lauke has the
				heart of a lion, and fiercely stands up for his friends.</p>

			<p>Lauke himself looks up to the savannah elders for wisdom and
				insight in times of trouble. Elijah the Parrot spends most of his
				time listening to drum and bass on his MP3 player, and may come
				across as a frazzled old raver, but he has many a wise word to say
				in difficult situations. And Armani the Lion, former leader of the
				pride but long since deposed, may seem to have lost his marbles, but
				sees and hears all.</p>

			<p>The movie starts with Lauke and Pete investigating a cry for
				help from some local gazelle kids, who came across something nasty
				at the edges of the plains. They have seen dark spirits mobilising,
				as if the dead themselves have been disturbed from their rest! Who
				is at the bottom of this disturbance? Their travels open up a whole
				world of adventure, pitting them against dark supernatural forces,
				greedy hunters and sinister desert warriors. The key to finding the
				answers they seek is a chance meeting with the Party flamingos, but
				can they make them speak sense?</p>
